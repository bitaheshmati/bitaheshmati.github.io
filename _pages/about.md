Hi, I'm Bita. I'm a second-year PhD student working at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. My research explores multimodal argumentation, specifically focusing on the potentially persuasive power of images and other visual elements in online public discussions. I became curious about this topic during my research master studies, which I completed in 2021 at this university. During that time, I had the chance to take my first course in argumentation theory with Dr. Jan Albert van Laar. He sparked my interest in this topic and subsequently supervised my master thesis on appeal to pity in visual argumentation. Currently, Dr. van Laar is co-supervising my doctoral project alongside Dr. Lotte van Poppel and Prof. dr. Kees de Glopper. I recently presented my research on the application of speech act theory to multimodal argumentation at the ISSA Conference in Leiden. 
Outside of academic work, my main interests are running, playing piano, kickboxing and enjoying social activities with friends!
